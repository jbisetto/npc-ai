## Test Infrastructure

- [ ] Set up test fixtures
  - [ ] Mock API responses
  - [ ] Sample requests
  - [ ] Test configurations

- [ ] Configure test environment
  - [ ] Test configuration files
  - [ ] Environment variables
  - [ ] Logging setup

- [ ] Create test utilities

  - [ ] Mock service providers

## Notes

1. Each component should have:
   - Unit tests for individual functions
   - Integration tests for component interactions
   - Mock external dependencies
   - Error case coverage

2. Test coverage goals:
   - Line coverage: 80%+
   - Branch coverage: 70%+
   - Function coverage: 90%+

3. Testing standards:
   - Use pytest fixtures
   - Mock external services
   - Clear test naming
   - Comprehensive docstrings
   - Test both success and failure cases
