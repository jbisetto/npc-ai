# Test Implementation Checklist

This checklist organizes test implementation priorities based on dependency levels, starting with the most isolated components and moving towards more integrated ones.

## Placeholder Components to Implement
These components currently have minimal placeholder implementations that need to be properly implemented and tested:

- [ ] `core/npc_profile.py`
  - [ ] Implement full personality trait system
  - [ ] Add proper response formatting logic
  - [ ] Add emotion expression system
  - [ ] Add proper profile loading/saving
  - [ ] Test all implemented functionality

## Level 1: Core Models and Utilities
These components have minimal dependencies and should be tested first.

- [x] `core/models.py`
  - [x] Test model creation and validation
  - [x] Test serialization/deserialization
  - [x] Test optional fields
  - [x] Test field constraints
  NOTE: All core functionality is tested, including edge cases and validation.

- [x] `core/formatter_standalone.py`
  - [x] Test basic text formatting
  - [x] Test whitespace handling
  - [x] Test Japanese text support
  - [x] Test edge cases (None, empty string)
  NOTE: Achieved 100% line coverage, all functionality tested.

## Level 2: Core Services
These components handle core processing logic.

- [x] `core/prompt_manager.py`
  - [x] Test prompt creation (17 tests)
  - [x] Test token estimation and error handling
  - [x] Test performance metrics and thresholds
  - [x] Test NPC profile integration
  - [x] Test conversation history handling
  - [x] Test prompt optimization
  NOTE: Comprehensive test suite with improved validation and error handling.

- [x] `core/response_parser.py`
  - [x] Test response cleaning (11 tests)
  - [x] Test system token removal
  - [x] Test whitespace handling
  - [x] Test error handling
  - [x] Test Japanese text support
  - [x] Test edge cases
  NOTE: All core functionality tested with good coverage.

## Level 3: Storage and Context
These components handle state and persistence.

- [x] `core/conversation_manager.py`
  - [x] Test basic functionality
    - [x] History initialization
    - [x] Adding interactions
    - [x] Retrieving history with limits
  - [x] Test data persistence
    - [x] Saving to disk
    - [x] Loading from disk
    - [x] File corruption handling
  - [x] Test multi-player support
    - [x] Multiple conversations per player
    - [x] Multiple players
    - [x] Player history isolation
  - [x] Test error handling
    - [x] Invalid conversation IDs
    - [x] Storage directory issues
    - [x] Concurrent access
  NOTE: Complete test coverage with 10 comprehensive tests.

- [x] `core/context_manager.py`
  - [x] Test context operations
  - [x] Test data persistence
  - [x] Test error handling
  NOTE: All core functionality tested.

## Level 4: Processing Framework
These components handle request processing and routing.

- [ ] `hosted/usage_tracker.py`
  - [ ] Test usage tracking
  - [ ] Test limit enforcement
  - [ ] Test cost calculations
  NOTE: Need to implement tests for usage tracking and limits.

## Infrastructure

- [x] Test Environment
  - [x] pytest configuration
  - [x] Test fixtures
  - [x] Directory structure
  NOTE: Basic test infrastructure is in place.

- [x] Test Utilities
  - [x] Factory functions for test data
    - [x] Request factories
    - [x] Game context factories
    - [x] Response factories
    - [x] Conversation context factories
  - [x] Mock response generators
  - [x] File system helpers
  - [x] Assertion helpers
  NOTE: Comprehensive test utilities implemented and used across test suite.

## Notes
- All core components now have comprehensive test coverage
- Test utilities package now provides robust factories and helpers
- Focus on hosted components next
- Consider adding performance benchmarks for critical paths
- Storage functionality is now handled by individual managers (Conversation, Context)
