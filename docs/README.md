# NPC AI Documentation

This directory contains design documentation, implementation guides, and future enhancement plans for the NPC AI system.

## Core Documentation

| Document | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [request_processing_flow.md](request_processing_flow.md) | Details the flow of NPC requests through the system, including processor selection and response formatting |
| [shutdown_and_cleanup.md](shutdown_and_cleanup.md) | Documents the proper shutdown sequence and resource cleanup procedures |
| [testing_and_debugging.md](testing_and_debugging.md) | Provides guidelines for testing and debugging the NPC AI system |
| [player_history_storage.md](player_history_storage.md) | Explains the design and implementation of the conversation history storage system |
| [initialization_sequence.md](initialization_sequence.md) | Describes the system startup and initialization process |
| [knowledge_management.md](knowledge_management.md) | Covers knowledge base management, vectorization, and retrieval |
| [configuration_reference.md](configuration_reference.md) | Reference for all configuration options in the system |
| [adapter_implementation_guide.md](adapter_implementation_guide.md) | Guide for implementing new adapters to convert between different data formats |

## Future Enhancements

See the [future_enhancements](future_enhancements) directory for planned improvements to the system.

## Document Maintenance

These documents are maintained alongside the codebase and should be updated whenever significant changes are made to the system. Each document follows a consistent format:

1. Overview/Introduction
2. Detailed explanation of the topic
3. Code examples where applicable
4. Diagrams for complex flows
5. Implementation notes and considerations

## Contributing Documentation

When adding new documentation:

1. Follow the established format and style
2. Include relevant code examples
3. Add diagrams for complex concepts (using Mermaid where possible)
4. Update cross-references in related documents
5. Add an entry to this README.md file
