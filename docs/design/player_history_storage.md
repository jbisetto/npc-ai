# Player History Storage Design

## Current Implementation

The player history is currently implemented using a file-based JSON storage system. Each player's history is stored in a separate JSON file, with in-memory caching for performance.

### Current Approach
- Storage: Individual JSON files per player
- Location: `src/data/player_history/`
- Format: `{player_id}.json`
- Caching: In-memory with disk persistence
- Access Pattern: Read on first access, write on update

### Advantages of Current Implementation
1. Simple to implement and debug
2. Human-readable data format
3. No external dependencies
4. Easy to backup and restore
5. Suitable for prototyping and development
6. Direct file system access for debugging

### Limitations
1. Not optimized for scale (many users)
2. No built-in indexing
3. Potential I/O bottlenecks
4. Limited concurrent access guarantees
5. No ACID properties
6. File system constraints

## Future Considerations

### Database Migration
When scaling becomes necessary, migration to a proper database system should be considered:

1. **Options**:
   - SQLite: For simple deployments
   - PostgreSQL: For production deployments
   - MongoDB: For maintaining JSON-like structure

2. **Benefits**:
   - Better concurrency handling
   - ACID compliance
   - Proper indexing
   - Query capabilities
   - Transaction support
   - Better performance at scale

### Vector Storage Potential

The conversation history data could be valuable for advanced features through vector storage:

1. **Use Cases**:
   - Semantic search across conversation history
   - Finding similar conversations/patterns
   - Enhanced context building
   - Model training and fine-tuning

2. **Architecture Consideration**:
   - Primary storage (DB) for raw history (source of truth)
   - Vector storage for semantic features (derived data)
   - Synchronization mechanism between the two

## Recommended Path Forward

### Short Term (Current)
1. **Maintain File-Based Storage**
   - Continue using JSON files for simplicity
   - Focus on core functionality
   - Suitable for current development phase

2. **Design for Future**
   - Abstract storage behind interfaces
   - Implement repository pattern
   - Make storage backend pluggable
   - Document storage format and schema

### Medium Term
1. **Database Migration**
   - Move to SQLite as intermediate step
   - Then PostgreSQL for production
   - Keep JSON as export/backup format
   - Implement proper migration tools

### Long Term
1. **Advanced Features**
   - Add vector storage capabilities
   - Implement event-based synchronization
   - Enhanced semantic search
   - Analytics and insights

## Decision

For the current phase of development, we will:
1. Keep the file-based JSON storage
2. Focus on implementing proper tests
3. Document the storage format
4. Design interfaces for future abstraction

This decision allows us to:
- Move quickly in development
- Maintain simplicity
- Defer complexity until needed
- Plan for future scaling

## Next Steps

1. Implement comprehensive tests for current implementation
2. Document JSON schema and storage format
3. Create interfaces for storage abstraction
4. Monitor performance and usage patterns
5. Identify trigger points for migration

## Future Migration Triggers

Consider migration when:
1. Number of users exceeds 1000
2. File I/O becomes a bottleneck
3. Concurrent access issues arise
4. Need for complex queries emerges
5. ACID properties become critical
