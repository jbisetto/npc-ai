1. Review the detailed proposal in the corresponding document
2. Create a tracking issue in the issue tracker
3. Follow the implementation plan outlined in the document
4. Update the relevant documentation
5. Add appropriate tests
6. Submit for code review

## Proposing New Enhancements

To propose a new enhancement:

1. Create a new markdown file in this directory
2. Follow the established format:
   - Executive summary/problem statement
   - Current implementation analysis
   - Proposed solution with code examples
   - Implementation plan
   - Expected benefits
3. Add an entry to this README.md file
4. Reference the proposal in the issue tracker

## Enhancement Status

The enhancement documents in this directory are in various stages of implementation:

- **Planned**: Initial proposal documented but implementation not yet started
- **In Progress**: Implementation work has begun
- **Completed**: Enhancement has been fully implemented
- **Deferred**: Enhancement has been postponed

Each enhancement proposal should include success criteria to determine when the enhancement is considered complete.
